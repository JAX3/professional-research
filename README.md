-Most Game studios user a GDD or a Game design document for creating a game the GamaSutra site has an article  on how to create one.

Another way studios test thier game is by running Closed Aplhas and Betas which allows players  to test the game  before final release usually in an older version ro a more buggy version of the game.
Useally to find bugs and help improve any features before release. Most betas are held a month-few weeks before launch. for example 
```
Ubisoft announced that The Division 2â€™s open beta will happen at the beginning of March.

The open beta will be available for PC, PS4 and Xbox One players from March 1-4. This will give Ubisoft just under two weeks to make final tweaks to The Division 2 prior to its official release on March 15, 2019.
```
This allows Ubisoft to  make adjustment before release
